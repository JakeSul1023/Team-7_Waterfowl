# Team-7_Waterfowl

Researchers have collected millions of spatially explicit data points on where waterfowl travel to and from across the United States. As migratory species, waterfowl such as mallards can fly hundreds of miles in a day to relocate during the fall and winter as they head from the northern to the southern United States. Our lab has conducted several analyses that help tell us when large migration events will occur and will help predict where those migratory waterfowl will finish their migration. We seek a team of students to create an app to map spatially explicit predictions on a map of the Mississippi River corridor of where mallard migrations will start and end given current (that day) climactic conditions. This web-based app has a chance of being very important to the public at large who will use it to gauge where large concentrations of waterfowl will be relocating to for both hunting and wildlife viewing uses. 

  

  

Skills - Students will need the ability to handle very large data sets, pull data from real-time data sensors (i.e., climate/weather gauges), have a familiarity with remote sensing data, and the ability to create interactive applications.
